            <p>Quoting from the README:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Postcard is a #![no_std] focused serializer and deserializer for Serde. Postcard aims to be convenient for developers in constrained environments, while allowing for flexibility to customize behavior as needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I first published <a href="https://docs.rs/postcard"><code>postcard</code></a> back in 2019, as a way to get &quot;all the good stuff from <a href="https://serde.rs">Serde</a>&quot; in a format that would work for embedded systems. Since then, people all over Rust are using Postcard as a general purpose, <a href="https://github.com/djkoloski/rust_serialization_benchmark">compact</a>, and flexible Serde format, not just embedded folks! Now, 3 years later or so, <strong>it has reached 1.0.0</strong>!</p>
<p>As of yesterday, June 20th, <a href="https://docs.rs/postcard"><code>postcard</code></a> v1.0.0 has been released.</p>
<p>This blog post is an extended overview of the changes since the last stable release, v0.7.3.</p>
<p>This work was made possible thanks to <a href="https://jamesmunns.com/blog/postcard-1-0-run/#sponsorship">sponsorship</a> from the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla Corporation</a>, and I'd like to thank them again for their support!</p>

            <p>Recently, I wanted to generate some sounds for <a href="/blog/mnemos-initial-release/">MnemOS</a>, and I wanted it to go fast.</p>
<p>This is a little mini-blog post describing how I did that using fixed point math, and reduced the total CPU usage to about 20% of the original amount.</p>

                MnemOS Initial Release Announcement
              </a>

            <p><img src="/blog/images/pellegrino-rack.jpg" alt="Pellgrino Rack" /></p>
<p>Today I'm introducing <strong>MnemOS</strong> v0.1.0, a small, general purpose operating system, written in Rust. MnemOS is designed for constrained hardware, including microcontrollers.</p>
<p>This release includes the v0.1.0 versions of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/mnemos/latest/kernel">The MnemOS Kernel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/mnemos-userspace/latest/userspace/">The MnemOS Userspace Library</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/mnemos-common/latest/mnemos_common/">The MnemOS Common Library</a>, which defines the System Call interface shared between userspace and kernel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together with the Pellegrino hardware system (pictured above), which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack">Eurorack modular synth</a> inspired rack system with LEGO mounting rails, it aims to support modular, home-built computer systems.</p>
<p>Although the capabilities are currently limited, it currently supports a number of features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mnemos.jamesmunns.com/user-guide/serial.html">Multiplexed serial ports</a>, allowing for &quot;TCP Port&quot; like addressing of services</li>
<li>An <a href="https://mnemos.jamesmunns.com/components/kernel.html#system-calls">RPC-style System Call interface</a>, powered by <a href="https://serde.rs">serde</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/postcard">postcard</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://docs.rs/mnemos-common/latest/mnemos_common/porcelain/block_storage/index.html">block storage interface</a>, useful for loading, storing, and retrieving programs and program data from persistent QSPI flash</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on what MnemOS is, and how to get started, you can refer to <a href="https://mnemos.jamesmunns.com">the MnemOS book</a>, or visit the <a href="https://github.com/jamesmunns/pellegrino">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>

<p>The new year continues with more hardware-related distractions.</p>
<p>This week, I went back to an old project from about a year ago, my <a href="https://github.com/jamesmunns/lipo-stamp">Lipo Stamp hardware</a>, which is a small battery charging, management, and protection PCB. It was designed to handle all of the &quot;battery hard stuff&quot;, so I didn't need to design that into every project.</p>
<p>As things go, I didn't end up ever testing or using these stamps at all, so they've been waiting in my drawer to be validated.</p>
