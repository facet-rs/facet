WASM client for facet-html-diff—applies DOM patches in the browser.

## Overview

This crate compiles to WebAssembly and provides functions to apply DOM patches
generated by `facet-html-diff` directly in the browser. It uses `web-sys` to
manipulate the live DOM, enabling efficient incremental updates without
replacing the entire document.

## Use Case

When you compute a diff server-side (or in Rust/WASM), you get a list of patches.
This crate takes those patches and applies them to the browser's DOM:

```text
Server: old HTML + new HTML  →  Vec<Patch>  →  JSON
                                                 ↓
Browser: apply_patches_json(json)  →  DOM mutations
```

## API

```rust
use facet_html_diff_wasm::apply_patches_json;

// In WASM context, apply patches to the current document
let patches_json = r#"[{"SetText":{"path":[0,1,0],"value":"Hello"}}]"#;
let count = apply_patches_json(patches_json)?;
```

## Patch Types Supported

- `SetText` - Update text content
- `SetAttribute` / `RemoveAttribute` - Modify element attributes
- `InsertBefore` / `InsertAfter` / `AppendChild` - Insert new nodes
- `Remove` - Delete nodes
- `Replace` / `ReplaceInnerHtml` - Replace node content
- `Move` - Relocate nodes within the DOM

## Building

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

This crate is primarily used for testing that `facet-html-diff` generates
correct patches by verifying them against a real browser DOM.
