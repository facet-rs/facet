# {{crate}}

Core types and helpers for diff rendering in Facet.

This crate provides shared infrastructure for rendering diffs across different
serialization formats (XML, JSON, TOML, etc.).

## Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Color |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `-` | Deleted | Red |
| `+` | Inserted | Green |
| `←` | Moved from here | Blue |
| `→` | Moved to here | Blue |

## Value-only coloring

Keys/field names stay neutral, only the changed VALUES are colored:

```text
- fill="red"    <- "red" is red, "fill=" is white
+ fill="blue"   <- "blue" is green, "fill=" is white
```

## Usage

This crate is typically used by serializers (facet-xml, facet-json, etc.) to
render diffs consistently. You probably want to use `facet-diff` directly
instead of this crate.
