Fast, no-regex English singularization.

## Overview

This crate converts plural English words to their singular form without using regex.
It's designed for use in deserialization where performance matters—for example, when
mapping JSON field names like `"dependencies"` to Rust struct fields like `dependency`.

## Example

```rust
use facet_singularize::singularize;

assert_eq!(singularize("dependencies"), "dependency");
assert_eq!(singularize("items"), "item");
assert_eq!(singularize("children"), "child");
assert_eq!(singularize("boxes"), "box");
assert_eq!(singularize("matrices"), "matrix");
```

## Features

- **No regex**: Uses simple suffix matching and table lookups
- **no_std compatible**: Works without the standard library (with `alloc` feature)
- **Irregular plurals**: Handles common exceptions like children→child, mice→mouse
- **Latin/Greek plurals**: Supports -ices→-ix (matrices→matrix), -ae→-a (larvae→larva)

## Performance

Benchmarked to be fast enough for hot paths. The implementation prioritizes
predictable performance over completeness—it handles the common cases well
rather than trying to be a full linguistic library.
