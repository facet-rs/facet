# tools

Internal development and benchmarking tools for the facet workspace. These crates are not published to crates.io.

## Workspace Structure

This is a separate Cargo workspace containing dev-only tools:

- **benchmark-defs** — Common benchmark definitions and argument parsing
- **benchmark-generator** — Generates unified benchmark code from templates
- **benchmark-analyzer** — Analyzes benchmark results and generates HTML reports
- **metrics-tui** — Interactive TUI for exploring compile-time metrics
- **perf-index-generator** — Generates index pages for perf.facet.rs
- **facet-bloatbench** — Compile-time and binary size benchmarking harness
- **facet-perf-shootout** — Performance shootout benchmarks (divan/criterion)

## Why a Separate Workspace?

These tools have heavy dependencies (axum, tokio, ratatui, divan) that would slow down `cargo check` for the main facet crates. By isolating them in their own workspace, we keep the core development loop fast.
