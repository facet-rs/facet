facet-bloatbench
================

Synthetic schema generator and A/B build-time/code-size benchmark used for comparing Facet vs Serde derives (and their JSON backends).

- Schema is produced by `cargo xtask schema` (200 structs / 60 enums by default).
- Facet path exercises `facet-json` via a small round-trip harness; Serde path uses `serde_json`.
- `cargo xtask schema-build` regenerates the schema, clears per-feature target dirs, and builds both variants with cargo timings enabled.

This crate is for internal benchmarking only and is not published.
