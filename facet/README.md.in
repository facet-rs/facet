facet provides reflection for Rust: it gives types a [`SHAPE`](Facet::SHAPE) associated
const with details on the layout, fields, doc comments, attributes, etc.

It can be used for many things, from (de)serialization to pretty-printing,
rich debuggers, CLI parsing, reflection in templating engines, code
generation, etc.

See <https://facet.rs> for details.

## Workspace contents

The main `facet` crate re-exports symbols from:

- [facet-core](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-core), which defines the main components:
  - The [`Facet`] trait and implementations for foreign types (mostly `libstd`)
  - The [`Shape`] struct along with various vtables and the whole [`Def`] tree
  - Type-erased pointer helpers like [`PtrUninit`], [`PtrConst`], and [`Opaque`]
  - Autoderef specialization trick needed for `facet-macros`
- [facet-macros](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-macros), which implements the [`Facet`] derive attribute as a fast/light proc macro powered by [unsynn](https://docs.rs/unsynn)

For struct manipulation and reflection, we have:

- [facet-reflect](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-reflect),
  allows building values of arbitrary shapes in safe code, respecting invariants.
  It also allows peeking at existing values.

Internal crates include:

- [facet-testhelpers](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-testhelpers) a simple log logger and color-backtrace configured with the lightweight btparse backend

## Ecosystem

Various crates live under the <https://github.com/facet-rs> umbrella, and their
repositories are kept somewhat-consistent through [facet-dev](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet-dev).

Crates are in various states of progress, buyer beware!

In terms of data formats, we have:

- [facet-json](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-json): JSON format support
- [facet-toml](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-toml): TOML format support
- [facet-yaml](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-yaml): YAML format support
- [facet-msgpack](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-msgpack): MessagePack deserialization
- [facet-asn1](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-asn1): ASN.1 format support
- [facet-xdr](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-xdr): XDR format support
- [facet-csv](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-csv): CSV format support

Still adjacent to serialization/deserialization, we have:

- [facet-urlencoded](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-urlencoded): URL-encoded form data deserialization
- [facet-args](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-args): CLI arguments (a-la clap)

As far as utilities go:

- [facet-value](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-value): Memory-efficient dynamic value type, supporting JSON-like data plus bytes
- [facet-pretty](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-pretty): Pretty-print Facet types
- [facet-diff](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-diff): Diffing capabilities for Facet types
- [facet-assert](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet/tree/main/facet-assert): Pretty assertions for Facet types (no PartialEq required)
- [facet-serialize](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet-serialize): Generic iterative serialization facilities
- [facet-deserialize](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet-deserialize): Generic iterative deserialization facilities

And the less developed:

- [facet-inspect](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet-inspect): Utilities to inspect the content of a Facet object

## Extended cinematic universe

Some crates are developed completely independently from the facet org:

- [facet-v8](https://github.com/simonask/facet-v8) provides an experimental Facet/v8 integration
- [facet-openapi](https://github.com/ThouCheese/facet-openapi) (experimental) Generates OpenAPI definitions from types that implement Facet
- [facet_generate](https://github.com/redbadger/facet-generate) reflects Facet types into Java, Swift and TypeScript
- [multi-array-list](https://lib.rs/crates/multi-array-list) provides an experimental `MultiArrayList` type
