Lightweight test helpers: a log facade that always does tracing (with colors),
and color-backtrace using the btparse backend.

## Usage

Add this to your test files:

```rust
#[facet_testhelpers::test]
fn my_test() {
    log::info!("This will be printed with color!");
    // Your test code here
}
```

The test macro sets up a simple logger that works with both `cargo test` and `cargo nextest run`.

### Recommendation

While this crate works with regular `cargo test`, we recommend using [`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st) for:
- Process-per-test isolation
- Faster parallel test execution
- Better test output and reporting

Install with:
```bash
cargo install cargo-nextest
```

Then run tests with:
```bash
cargo nextest run
```
