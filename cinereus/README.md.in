GumTree-style tree diffing with Chawathe edit script generation.

This crate provides a generic tree diffing algorithm based on the GumTree approach:

1. **Top-down matching**: Finds identical subtrees by hash
2. **Bottom-up matching**: Matches remaining nodes by structural similarity
3. **Chawathe edit script**: Generates minimal INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, and MOVE operations

Used by `facet-diff` for structural comparison of Facet types.
