# facet-html-diff

Diff two HTML documents and produce a series of DOM patches to morph one into the other.

## Purpose

Given HTML documents A and B, this crate computes the minimal set of DOM operations needed
to transform A into B. The patches can be serialized and sent to a browser, where they can
be applied incrementally without replacing the entire document.

This enables efficient live-reloading and hot-updating of web pages.

## Example

```rust
use facet_html_diff::{diff_html, apply_patches, parse_html};

let old = "<html><body><p>Hello</p></body></html>";
let new = "<html><body><p>Goodbye</p></body></html>";

let patches = diff_html(old, new).unwrap();

// Apply patches to transform old -> new
let mut doc = parse_html(old).unwrap();
apply_patches(&mut doc, &patches).unwrap();
assert_eq!(doc.to_html(), "<body><p>Goodbye</p></body>");
```

## Chawathe Semantics

This crate implements [Chawathe edit script semantics][chawathe], which differ from
typical array splice operations:

- **Insert and Move do NOT shift siblings** - they *displace* whatever node currently
  occupies the target position into a numbered *slot*
- **Slots hold displaced nodes** for potential later reinsertion via Move
- **Each operation specifies an exact position** - the edit script is position-independent

This model matches tree semantics (parent-child relationships) rather than array indices,
and enables efficient expression of operations like "swap these two nodes".

See [`cinereus/CHAWATHE_SEMANTICS.md`](../cinereus/CHAWATHE_SEMANTICS.md) for the full explanation.

## How It Works

```text
         facet-html              facet-diff                facet-html-diff
              │                      │                           │
   HTML A ────┼──► typed structs ────┼──► GumTree matching ──────┼──► Patch list
   HTML B ────┘                      │    Chawathe edit script ──┘
                                     │
                              cinereus (tree diff engine)
```

1. Parse both HTML documents using `facet-html` into typed Rust structs
2. Compute structural diff using `cinereus` (GumTree matching + Chawathe edit script)
3. Translate edit operations into DOM patches with slot-based displacement
4. Apply via `apply_patches()` or serialize for browser use with `facet-html-diff-wasm`
