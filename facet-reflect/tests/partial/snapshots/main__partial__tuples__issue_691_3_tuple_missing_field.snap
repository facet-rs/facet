Field '(String, i32, bool)::2' was not initialized. If you need to leave fields partially initialized and come back later, use deferred mode (begin_deferred/finish_deferred) at Path { shape: Shape { type_identifier: "(…)", ty: User(Struct(«kind: Tuple, fields: 3»)), layout: Sized(«32 align 8»), .. }, steps: [] }
